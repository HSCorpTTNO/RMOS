# RMOS

RMOS is a UNIX-like Operating System written in C and Assembly. It is currently in its early stages of development.  
Anyone wanting to test this can clone it locally and run the kernel image in a virtualized environment such as QEMU or vmware.

Please note legacy support is not yet here, thus running qemu will raise 
CPU EXCEPTION 0x01 with a message saying: ***LEGACY HARDWARE IS NOT SUPPORT YET. RASING ISRQ AT VECTOR 0x01***
